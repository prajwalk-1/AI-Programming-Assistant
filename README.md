# AI Programming Assistant

## Objective

The **AI Programming Assistant** is designed to help users learn programming by providing answers to coding-related questions, offering explanations for programming concepts, generating code snippets, and suggesting example problems for practice. The assistant leverages advanced language models, including GPT-4, to simulate an intelligent programming tutor.

---

## Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: For managing question-and-answer workflows, facilitating conversation-based interactions, and building the AI model chain.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: Used for generating responses and handling coding-related queries.
- **Python**: The core backend programming language used for the development of the assistant.
- **Flask**: Framework for building the user interface (UI) to interact with the assistant.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and managing configuration.
- **GitHub**: For version control and hosting the codebase.

---

## Explanation

The **AI Programming Assistant** uses the power of the OpenAI GPT-4 model, along with LangChain’s tools, to enable efficient Q&A, code debugging, and learning. The system is built around a Flask web interface where users can interact with the assistant by typing programming-related questions.

- **LangChain**: Helps build an interactive workflow for Q&A sessions and handles conversation context, making the interaction feel like a continuous conversation rather than isolated questions and answers.
- **GPT-4**: Powers the assistant's natural language processing, enabling it to provide intelligent responses, code snippets, and explanations in real-time.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework that allows for easy integration of the assistant’s backend with a frontend interface.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajwalk-1/AI-Programming-Assistant.git
```

### Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- For Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- For macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set up OpenAI API Key
You’ll need to set up the OpenAI API key for the GPT-4 model. Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your system or pass it directly when initializing the assistant.

For Windows:
```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

For macOS/Linux:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Step 5: Run the Application
Start the Flask server:
```bash
python main.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to interact with the assistant.
